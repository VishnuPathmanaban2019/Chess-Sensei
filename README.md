A short description of the project's name and what it does:
==============================================================================
ChessSensei is a chess software package with two modes: player versus player 
and player versus AI. At the userâ€™s request, the ChessSensei AI uses a modified
minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to advise the player with a suggested 
move while also backtracking the tree to explain why they should make that move 
in a verbal message. Essentially, the software pushes beginners to start 
thinking like chess players and gain experience.

How to run the project:
